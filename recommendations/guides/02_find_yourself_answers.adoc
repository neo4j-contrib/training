== Exercise: Find yourself and your groups

We've now got groups, topics and members loaded into our database so it's time for a bit more exploration.

* If you're local, write a query to find yourself in the database. If not try and find your neighbour.
* How many groups are you a member of?
* Which topics do those groups have?
* _(For bonus points)_ Which topic shows up the most?

== Find yourself

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (m:Member)
WHERE m.name = {name}
RETURN m
----

== Find yourself

We can also inline the equality of the `name` property which will compile down to the same query plan:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (m:Member {name: {name}})
RETURN m
----

== How many groups are you a member of?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (m:Member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group)
WHERE m.name = {name}
RETURN group
----

== Which topics do these groups have?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (m:Member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group), (group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(topic)
WHERE m.name = {name}
RETURN group, topic
----


== Which topic shows up the most?

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (m:Member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group), (group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(topic)
WHERE m.name = {name}
RETURN topic.name, COUNT(*) AS times
ORDER BY times DESC
----
