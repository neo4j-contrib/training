== Events

So far we've only made recommendations for Meetup groups that we might like to join.
It's been fun but things start getting much more interesting once we bring events into the equation.

== Exploring events data

We'll start with exploration of the events CSV file:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}events.csv" AS row
RETURN row
LIMIT 5
----

As you can see we've got an event id, name, time, and description as well as some ids that reference other entities.

== Create constraints and indexes

First a bit of preparatory work before we import the events:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (e:Event) ASSERT e.id IS UNIQUE
----

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Event(time)
----

Now we're all set to import the events into the graph. Remember this is the model that we're moving towards:

image::{img}/events.png[]

== Import Events

Run the following query to import the events:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 10000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}events.csv" AS row
MERGE (event:Event {id: row.id})
ON CREATE SET event.name = row.name,
              event.time = toInt(row.time),
              event.utcOffset = toInt(row.utc_offset)
----

Let's check that the events imported correctly:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (event:Event)
RETURN event
LIMIT 10
----

Looks good!

== Connect events and groups

Our events are floating around not connected to anything so let's resolve that.
We'll use the `groupId` field from the CSV file to lookup a group that we created earlier and create a relationship between the event and group:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 10000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}events.csv" AS row

WITH distinct row.group_id as groupId, row.id as eventId
MATCH (group:Group {id: groupId})
MATCH (event:Event {id: eventId})
MERGE (group)-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(event)
----

Run the following query to check that worked as expected:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes,none]
----
MATCH (group:Group)-[hosted:HOSTED_EVENT]->(event)
WHERE group.name STARTS WITH "NYC Neo4j" AND event.time < timestamp()
RETURN event, group, hosted
ORDER BY event.time DESC
LIMIT 10
----

If all's well you should see the last 10 events hosted by the Neo4j Meetup group.

== Find future events in my groups

The simplest event recommendation we can make is to find the groups weâ€™re a member of and then find its future events.
We'll start with that and build from there:

include::form.adoc[tags=name]

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (member:Member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(group)-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(futureEvent)
WHERE member.name CONTAINS {name} AND futureEvent.time > timestamp()
RETURN group.name,
       futureEvent.name,
       round((futureEvent.time - timestamp()) / (24.0*60*60*1000)) AS days
ORDER BY days
----

That's a good start but it's a bit restrictive - I'm never going to learn about events in groups that I haven't joined yet.

== Layered recommendations

== Find future events for my topics

One way we could make a better recommendation is to suggest events hosted by groups that have my topics even if I'm not a member of those groups.

include::form.adoc[tags=name]

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (member:Member) WHERE member.name CONTAINS {name}
MATCH (member)-[:INTERESTED_IN]->()<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-()-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(futureEvent) WHERE futureEvent.time > timestamp()

WITH member, futureEvent, EXISTS((member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->()-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(futureEvent)) AS myGroup

WITH member, futureEvent, myGroup, COUNT(*) AS commonTopics
MATCH (futureEvent)<-[:HOSTED_EVENT]-(group)

RETURN futureEvent.name, futureEvent.time, group.name, commonTopics, myGroup
ORDER BY futureEvent.time
----

This query:

  * finds all future events
  * checks whether those events are hosted by a group that we're a member of
  * counts how many common topics we have with the group hosting the event
  * finds the group hosting the event
  * returns the events ordered by time

ifdef::env-training[]

== Exercise: Extending events recommendation

Update the recommendations query to:

* Filter out events which have less than 3 common topics
* Only show events happening in the next 7 days

== You know the drill by now!

endif::env-training[]

== Sorting the results

We have ~ 300 events that we can recommend to people but at the moment we don't show them in any particular order - we just sort them in date order.
We can do better by using the information that we've captured explaining the relationship between the user and the event.
i.e. we know whether the event is in our group and we know how many of our topics it covers.

We'll give a score of `5` if it's an event in one of our groups, add that to the number of common topics, add a penalty for events further in the future and then order by the total.

include::form.adoc[tags=name2]

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (member:Member) WHERE member.name CONTAINS {name2}
MATCH (member)-[:INTERESTED_IN]->()<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-()-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(futureEvent)
WHERE timestamp() + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) > futureEvent.time > timestamp()

WITH member, futureEvent, EXISTS((member)-[:MEMBER_OF]->()-[:HOSTED_EVENT]->(futureEvent)) AS myGroup
WITH member, futureEvent, myGroup, COUNT(*) AS commonTopics
WHERE commonTopics >= 3
MATCH (futureEvent)<-[:HOSTED_EVENT]-(group)

WITH futureEvent, group, commonTopics, myGroup, CASE WHEN myGroup THEN 5 ELSE 0 END AS myGroupScore
WITH futureEvent, group, commonTopics, myGroup, myGroupScore, round((futureEvent.time - timestamp()) / (24.0*60*60*1000)) AS days

RETURN futureEvent.name, futureEvent.time, group.name, commonTopics, myGroup, days, myGroupScore + commonTopics - days AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

== Next Step

Next we're going to introduce venues into the model so we can make recommendations based on where events are being held.
