== `LOAD CSV` is an ETL Power Tool

[options={options}]
* Load CSV data from a http or file URL
* Create, update or extend graph structures
* Transform and convert CSV values
* Allows us to import *into* our graph model
* Up to 10M nodes & relationships

// :csv-url: 'http://localhost:8000/content/training/intro/intro-cypher-interactive/data/'
// :csv-url: http://data.neo4j.com/intro/movies
:csv-url: http://data.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/intro/movies
:movies-url: http://data.neo4j.com/intro/movies/movies.csv
:people-url: http://data.neo4j.com/intro/movies/people.csv
:actors-url: http://data.neo4j.com/intro/movies/actors.csv

== This is our CSV Data

=== movies.csv

[options=headers]
,===
include::{movies-url}[lines=1..3]
,===

=== people.csv

[options=headers]
,===
include::{people-url}[lines=1..3]

=== actors.csv

== Reading data from CSV with Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV     // load csv data
WITH HEADERS // optionally use first header row as keys in 'row' map
FROM 'url'   // 'file:///data.csv' or  'http://.../data.csv' URL
AS row       // return each row of the CSV as list of strings or map
FIELDTERMINATOR ';' // alternative delimiter

... rest of the Cypher statement ...
----

NOTE: If you use file URLs, access is limited to within `$NEO4J_HOME/import`.

== LOAD CSV - Data Inspection

=== Row Count

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV FROM
 '{movies-url}' AS row
RETURN count(*);
----

=== Row as List Data

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV FROM
 '{movies-url}' AS row
RETURN * LIMIT 5;
----

== LOAD CSV - WITH HEADERS

=== Row as Map Data

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM
 '{movies-url}' AS row
RETURN row, keys(row) LIMIT 5;
----

=== Data Conversion

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM
     '{movies-url}' AS row
RETURN row.title as title, toInt(row.released) as released, row.tagline as tagline
ORDER BY released DESC LIMIT 10;
----

== Let's create some nodes & relationships

You know how it works, just use `CREATE` or `MERGE`

What would these statements look like:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (m:Movie {title:'The Matrix', released: 1999, tagline: '...'});
----

[source,cypher]
----
`MERGE`  (p:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves'}) ON CREATE SET p.born = 1964;
----

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name:'Keanu Reeves'}), (m:Movie {title:'The Matrix'})
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:['Neo']}]->(m);
----


== LOAD CSV - Create Nodes

=== CREATE Movies

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM
     '{movies-url}' AS row
CREATE (m:Movie {title: row.title, released: toInt(row.released), tagline: row.tagline})
RETURN m;
----

=== MERGE People

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM
     '{people-url}' AS row
MERGE (p:Person {name: row.name}) ON CREATE SET p.born = toInt(row.born)
RETURN p;
----

== LOAD CSV - Create Relationships

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM
     '{actors-url}' AS row
FIELDTERMINATOR ','
MATCH  (p:Person {name: row.person })
MATCH  (m:Movie  {title: row.movie})
MERGE (p)-[actedIn:ACTED_IN]->(m)
ON CREATE SET actedIn.roles = split(row.roles,';')
RETURN *;
----

== Meet the LOAD CSV Wizard

*Optional Trainer Demo and Excercise*
////

== Clean out Database

Click and run to *clean out your database*

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n;
----

== Import our Domain Data as a Script

[source,cypher]
