= Cypher: The Basics

== Cypher: The Basics

In this guide we'll introduce the main keywords in the Cypher query language and write some queries to get familiar with them.

Let's get started!

== The `WHERE` clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter results.
e.g. we could use it to look up `Tom Hanks` in our dataset:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN p
----

This query:

* scans through all nodes which have the label `Person`
* filters those which have the value `Tom Hanks` for the `name` property
* returns any matching nodes

Try the names of some other actors to see if they're in our dataset.

== Exercise: `WHERE` syntactic sugar

Can you work out the syntactic sugar for looking up a person without using a `WHERE` clause?

_Hint_ The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/#query-match[Cypher query language section] of the developer manual may come in handy.

== Answer: `WHERE` syntactic sugar

The following query is equivalent:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})
RETURN person
----

== Exercise: Find the people who acted in Top Gun

Can you write a query to find all the people who acted in the movie `Top Gun`?
You can use the syntactic sugar or long hand version of `WHERE`, whichever you prefer!

== Answer: Find the people who acted in Top Gun

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Top Gun'
RETURN p.name
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Top Gun'})
RETURN p.name
----

== More on `WHERE`

As well as matching on string equality Cypher also supports `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, and `CONTAINS` operators.
e.g. if we want to find all the actors whose first name is `Tom` we could write the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
RETURN p
----

== Exercise: Find people whose names start with 'Kevin' and any movies they’ve acted in.

Try and write a query to find people whose names start with `Kevin` and any movies they’ve acted in.

Once you've done that write some queries using `ENDS WITH` and `CONTAINS`.

_Hint_ Don't forget to look at the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/#query-where-string[String matching] section of the developer manual.

== Answer: Find people whose names start with 'Kevin' and any movies they’ve acted in.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Kevin'
RETURN p, m
----

== Aliasing in the `RETURN` clause

We can alias the names of the values returned in `RETURN` statements by using the `AS` keyword:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
RETURN m.title AS title
----

== Aggregates

Next we're going to write some queries that make use of aggregates, but first a quick explanation.

== Aggregates

Run the following query to find the number of movies that each person acted in:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, count(*) AS movies
----

== `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses

A more interesting query would be to find the people who acted in the most movies.
We can use the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses to find the top 5 busiest people:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, count(*) AS movies
ORDER BY movies DESC
LIMIT 5
----

== Exercise: Find the top five movies with the most actors.

Can you write a query that finds the movies with the most actors rather than the actors with the most movies?

== Answer: Find the top five movies with the most actors.

We only need to change the previous query slightly to do this:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title, count(*) AS actors
ORDER BY actors DESC
LIMIT 5
----

== Duplicates

The following query finds the people that have co-acted with Meg Ryan:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),
      (other:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE p.name = 'Meg Ryan'
RETURN other.name
----

Why do some people show up multiple times?

== Duplicates

Meg Ryan has worked with some people in more than one movie, that's why!
We can run the following query to include the movie that they appeared in together:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),
      (other:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE p.name = 'Meg Ryan'
RETURN other.name, m.title
ORDER BY other.name
----

== The `DISTINCT` keyword

If we really are only interested in a list of co-actors then we can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove any duplicates.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),
      (other:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE p.name = 'Meg Ryan'
RETURN DISTINCT other.name
----

== More `MATCH` clause

We can write a more complex `MATCH` statement that finds the directors that Meg Ryan's has worked with:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie),
      (other:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m),
      (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
WHERE p.name = 'Meg Ryan'
RETURN m.title AS movie,
       director.name AS director,
       other.name AS coActor
----

== Patterns in the `WHERE` clause

As well as filtering on properties we can also filter based on patterns.
e.g. Let's find the people who wrote and produced a movie:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(m:Movie)
WHERE (p)-[:PRODUCED]->(m)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== (Negative) Patterns in the `WHERE` clause

Negative patterns are allowed as well.
e.g. Let's find the people who wrote a movie but didn't produce it:


[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(m:Movie)
WHERE NOT (p)-[:PRODUCED]->(m)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== OR with relationship types

Sometimes we'll want to find one relationship or another.
We can combine relationship types together using the `|` symbol to do this:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN|:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Danny DeVito'
RETURN p.name, type(r), m.title
----

== Exercise: Find people who have not acted in or directed a movie.

Now it's your turn!

If you finish early the answer is on the next page.

== Answer: Find people who have not acted in or directed a movie.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE NOT (p)-[:ACTED_IN|:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)
RETURN p
----

== The `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause

The following query finds all the Toms that have directed a movie:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

But what if we want to find all the Toms in the database even if they haven't directed a movie?

== The `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause

`OPTIONAL MATCH` matches patterns against your graph database, just like `MATCH` does.
The difference is that if no matches are found, `OPTIONAL MATCH` will use NULLs for missing parts of the pattern.
`OPTIONAL MATCH` could be considered the Cypher equivalent of the outer join in SQL.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== The `COLLECT` function

`COLLECT` collects all the values into a list, grouped by all the other non-aggregate fields in the statement.
e.g. we could write the following query to find actors grouped by movie title.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title STARTS WITH 'The Matrix'
RETURN m.title, collect(p.name) AS actors
----

== The `WITH` clause

The `WITH` clause allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.
e.g. if we want to find people who have acted in more than 5 movies we could write the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH p, collect(m.title) AS movies
WHERE size(movies) > 5
RETURN p.name, movies
----

== The `WITH` clause

We can tweak that query slightly to get the movies sorted alphabetically.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH p, m
ORDER BY m.title
WITH p, collect(m.title) AS movies
WHERE size(movies) > 5
RETURN p.name, movies
----

== The `WITH` clause

If we want to find the movies that the two oldest actors appeared in we could write the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)

WITH actor
ORDER BY actor.born
LIMIT 2 
MATCH (actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)

WITH actor, movie 
ORDER BY movie.released DESC
RETURN actor.name,
       2016 - actor.born AS age,
       COLLECT(movie.title)[..3] AS movies
----

== The `SIZE()` function

If we to find the size of a list we can use the `SIZE` function.
We can also pass in a pattern expression and it will calculate the size of the result of evaluating that expression:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p.name,
       SIZE((p)-[:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)) AS prod
ORDER BY prod DESC
LIMIT 5
----

== The `SIZE()` function

The following query finds people who have produced more than 5 movies:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE size((p)-[:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)) > 5
RETURN p.name
----

== Exercise: Find the top five actors by how many movies they’ve acted in and movies they’ve directed, if any.

Your turn again!

== Answer: Find the top five actors by how many movies they’ve acted in and movies they’ve directed, if any.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)

WITH p, size((p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)) AS movies
ORDER BY movies DESC
LIMIT 5

OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

== The `UNWIND` clause

The `UNWIND` clause is the opposite of `COLLECT`.
It explodes a list of values so that we have one row per value.

[source, cypher]
----
WITH [1, 2, 3] AS list
RETURN list
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH [1, 2, 3] AS list
UNWIND list AS row
RETURN row
----

== Using the `UNWIND` clause

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)

WITH p, m
ORDER BY m.released

WITH p, collect(m)[..3] AS topThree
UNWIND topThree AS m
MATCH (dir:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
RETURN p.name, m.title, dir.name
----

== Variable length paths

In all the queries we've done so far we've specified every part of the pattern that we're looking for.
Cypher also allows us to define variable length paths where we specify the number of hops to look for.

e.g. we can write the following query to find how `Tom Cruise` and `Kevin Bacon` are connected by up to 4 `ACTED_IN` relationships.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p = (p1:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*..4]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'Tom Cruise' AND
      p2.name = 'Kevin Bacon'
RETURN p
----

== Variable length paths

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p = (p1:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*4..6]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'Tom Cruise' AND
      p2.name = 'Kevin Bacon'
RETURN p
----

== Variable length paths

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p = (p1:Person)-[:ACTED_IN*4..6]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'Tom Cruise' AND
      p2.name = 'Kevin Bacon'
RETURN [x IN nodes(p) |
  CASE WHEN x:Person THEN x.name
       WHEN x:Movie  THEN x.title
  ELSE '' END
] AS path
----

== Shortest path

Cypher also has a `shortestPath` function which will look for the quickest way to go between two nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p = shortestPath((p1:Person)-[*]-(p2:Person))
WHERE p1.name = 'Tom Cruise' AND
      p2.name = 'Kevin Bacon'
RETURN p
----

== Exercise: Find the shortest path between Top Gun and The Matrix through any relationship type.

Your turn.

== Answer: Find the shortest path between Top Gun and The Matrix through any relationship type.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p = shortestPath((m1:Movie)-[*]-(m2:Movie))
WHERE m1.title = 'Top Gun' AND
      m2.title = 'The Matrix'
RETURN p
----

== Exercise: Recommend 3 actors that Keanu Reeves should work with, but hasn’t.

And again.

== Answer: Recommend 3 actors that Keanu Reeves should work with, but hasn’t.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(c),
(c)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coc)
WHERE p.name = 'Keanu Reeves'
	AND coc <> p
 	AND NOT (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(coc)
RETURN coc.name as colleagueOfColleague, count(coc) as weight
ORDER BY weight DESC
LIMIT 3
